0,"I have been the loyal member of the Projector for 4 years plus and I am very appreciated that Singapore is having such a place to chill out other than mainstream cinemas. And I am so glad that the projector survive and thrive through the difficult period of pandemic and now doing great with different outlets other than here. They offer annual membership including four free tickets and after that you can buy tickets using member price. The have a wide selection of movies you won‚Äôt find else where mainstream cinemas in Singapore, some indie or featured work from a rising star director. Other than watching it in golden mile tower or other location, they also offer a streaming service that you can rent the movies. The outlet itself also keeps the nostalgia vibe of 80‚Äôs, the seating in the cinema remain the same as you were a time traveler. Some rooms also have the seating like sofa and beanbags, isn‚Äôt it cool .. I like they really put into thought on the decorations to keep the old and new in the same place which is interesting enough to attract the youngsters. On the way to the rest room, they have a large mural wall and sometimes you will see influencers taking pictures there. Here also have a bar providing simple food and beverages, my go to order every time is iced coffee, come here and enjoy and definitely a place to give you the energy",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
1,"Last I came by, it was for a corporate screening of Lei Yuan Bin's Baby Queen during Pride Month 2023. Enjoyed the documentary and the performances that followed. As another reviewer has written, the seats in another hall are 'steeply tiered'. It can feel dangerous walking in between the rows of seats at the back of that hall, but I suppose if earlier generations could do it, so can we. I used to work at Sinema Old School, and I tend to think of The Projector as its descendant in spirit.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
2,"Great vibes, cool film selections and at decent prices too. All that and you can have a pint while watching! Loads of curated specials from V-Day movies (Wong Kar Wai! Beautiful choice.) to film festival screenings to music events‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs truly something for everybody :)",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
3,Old school vibes though ventilation felt weak and mixed with bar food and dust. Cinema seats are steeply tiered.,The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
4,"Very unique art house Cinema with a retro inventory, that has been chosen by heart an passion for cinematography to give this beautiful cinema a real soul! ‚ù§Ô∏è  I really liked the vibe, the ambiente and the people üé•  Tickets could easily be bought online for 11,50 S$ per adult. Happy hours are from 5 to 8 pm.  Great place to see movies, can only strongly recommend ‚úåüèº",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
5,"the perfect hangout place for cinephiles. interior is very artsy, film selection is quite diverse. i signed up for the projector fan club for the free tix and discounts which is a quite a steal especially if you plan on visiting quite often.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
6,Used to go here almost every month during my hipster phase in uni. Just went back to catch Decision To Leave yesterday and enjoyed myself. Building is super old but adds to the vibe.,The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
7,"Awesome vibe, perfect place for hipsters to enjoy a movie! It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre watching a movie back in the good old days of cinema. Complete old school experience with the hollow acoustics, imperfectly comfortable seats, and IPA draft (comes with a free holder aka your thigh).",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
8,Still my favourite place in Singapore. Thank you for all the great movies and amazing memories I had here.,The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
9,"I went there just because I want to use the photoautomat and it was very nice, you can exchange your money to coins to use the photobooth, but it will be very nice of you if you also buy a drink from the bar. For you people who love photograph, it is a nice place to get your shot here.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
10,"Food and drinks menu is the same as the one Projector: Picturehouse however there way more vintage stuff to see here, paintings and murals on the walls, even posters in the toilet.  The seats are much less comfortable compared to picturehouse though, no cupholder to put your drinks and the seats are vintage.  There are beanbags you can lie on to watch the movie if you desire.  Highly recommend the triple grilled cheese sandwich and the beef sausage bun, haram teh was amazing too.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
11,"Absolutely loved catching and indie Japanese film here. The vibe of the whole cinema is awesome. Very retro, groovy and artsy. Loved the pre-movie video for turning your phone off - it had everyone laughing! Feels like you're stepping out of time and out of Singapore in the Projector! Highly recommend!",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
12,"An extremely unique cinema with a Gen Z vibe environment that is picturesque, unique and a worthy cinema worth experiencing in Singapore. Truly a once in a lifetime cinema that is extremely different than most cinemas. Love the Vibes, Happy Hour (till 8pm on Weekdays). Fun fact: you can bring all their food and drinks into the cinemas (alcohol served there as well)",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
13,"Old school movie theater with lots of retro props from the 80's.  The vibe is cool, but the area is a bit ghetto.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,

17,"Cool space, friendly staff and had fun with the photo booth! Theatre was alright, not too hot or cold :-) Hope to come back again, love the cute straws they got",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
18,"The halls are generally rather rundown and the seats old. When you take a seat initially, there will be creaky noises without fail. The steps in the bigger hall can be steep.  Only Blue hall has the washrooms just outside, making it the most accessible. BUT, only 2 cubicles for ladies AND 1 cubicle has been CLOSED for repairs for so many months! Wonder why?  Update: both cubicles are available for use! Hurray",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
19,Always a great time at the Projector. We‚Äôll definitely miss the spot at the Golden Mile.,The Projector,4.6,Cinema,

21,"I liked it, a bit cold but very nice place to see a movie",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
22,"loved the experience! I didn't so much like the popcorn- I got the cinnamon one but it wasn't glazed like I thought it would be so it was so-so to me though those who don't mind unglazed popcorn might like it! Their thai milk tea was nice, though. The theatre was nice and comfy and they have these pamphlets for the month's screenings out to take that are really cute! I watched Crimes of the Future here and #traumatised...just kidding HAHA no but really. Had a great experience!",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
23,Old but charming cinema! I love the movies being shown here.,The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
24,"Cool place for movies and drinks, always love the film selection/ curation",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
25,"My favorite cinema in Singapore for the fantastic curation of independent and foreign movies. Brings back memories of the 80s when this same cinema was the nearest to my grandparents' place so I was actually here as a little kid! Even though the place is old, it's been spruced up super nice and clean. I also love that I can have a glass of wine with the movie - or at least that was the case before the lockdown. I'm so glad this place survived the lockdown and can't wait to be back!",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
26,"Watched Park Chan-wook's ""Decision to Leave"", great sound system, love that they let us bring bar bites (seafood wontons with chilli crab sauce is mind-blowing btw) and drinks into the theatre. Cozy ambience and confortable seats, will return!",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
27,"I always come back to watch hard to catch movies here. The food here is pretty great as well, a bit pricey but big portions!",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
28,"Place gave a retro feel, which was interesting, but the customer service was unsatisfactory.  It was not clear that we needed to sit 2 seats apart, and we were forced to move seats right before the movie started. This created a lot of inconvenience as the room was dark.  Furthermore, there was poor enforcement of this rule. We were forced to move despite having arrived earlier than a group of 4 people to our right (who also did not follow the 2 seats apart rule) but were allowed to move one seat to the right, leaving no seats left for us to follow the rule.  We had to find new seats in the dark when most people were already seated and hence had to move to the back. We came early to get good seats for a reason and it was supposed to be free seating.  This has ruined the movie experience for us.  UPDATE(7 Sept 2022): Despite the offer of movie vouchers as seen in their reply, I have been waiting for almost 2 years for these vouchers to materialise. Take it as you will.",The Projector,4.6,Cinema,
29,"First time here and it was truly impressive! We took the massage and onsen access set menu which is really worthy in our opinion.  Convenient location, just right out of stadium station and follow the direction signage to Yunomori. Fast check-in process. Clear instructions inside the onsen area and many staff to help you out.

30,"The last time I visited this place was more than a year ago, nothing much has changed.  The staff at reception counter were polite, service was ok but they left new customers‚Äô application forms lying at the counter without covering the personal particulars.  The staff at the changing room cleaned and wiped the floor dry prompted. It would be great if they could remind inconsiderate customers to close the doors when entering or leaving the onsen area.  There onsen bath was good with cold, hot, bubble, jet bath, etc.  The changing room was still cramped, about 3-4 dryers were available. That‚Äôs nothing much they could do unless re-renovate the place.  The staff at the cafe were friendly and polite. The food was average or above average which was totally acceptable given the reasonable pricing.  Have not tried their massage, no comment.  Overall good experience and it would be more pleasant if verbal education/reminders can be given to customers to bathe before going into the onsen, close the door when entering and leaving the onsen.",Yunomori Onsen & Spa,4.2,Massage spa,"Wednesday, 10 am to 10 pm; Thursday, 10 am to 10 pm; Friday, 10 am to 10 pm; Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm; Sunday, 10 am to 10 pm; Monday, 10 am to 10 pm; Tuesday, 10 am to 10 pm.

33,"I used to give this place 5 stars and I even sign up a membership with them. However, recently, not only the prices went up but even if you do their massages, not all massages come with onsen entry anymore. Quality of the cafe also has dropped.

34,Place cannot take alot photo so jus one to sum up. Its very clean and neat place. Every ladies know how to maintain the place when using it.

35,"Had a deep-sleep massage + Onsen for first tine experience here and it did not disappointment me instead impressed me with the very relaxing 60 min massage, serene ambiance, yummy food and unintimidating onsen. It's worth every $ experience. Im so gonna bring my children next time so they can experience the onsen. Renting/wearing Yukata and Obi is such a cute part in this experience so I made sure I take photos. Onsen has 6 baths and a sauna room which i believe one can stay 1-2hours.

36,Today the onsen is really crowed due to holiday season. I don‚Äôt understand why they allow chopping seat! So many people come in and out to seek to a space to rest.

38,"Really looking forward to my trip here as I couldn't stand this rainy CNY season anymore and I'm due for a much needed break after working for 2 weeks straight without a day off until today so naturally I have high expectations  I was there from 2 to 9pm. Staffs are hospitable and helpful, they will ask if you're a first timer and guide you through the onsen steps. Environment is very comfortable and clean, after taking my first onsen dip I head to the cafe for salmon chawanmushi, food was not hot enough but still quite tasty. Then I took a nap at the lounge for an hour or two. Temperature was just right and I doze off right away after food & onsen.  Woke up and went for a second dip, this time more people, around 10-15 even on a monday. Had to queue for awhile to use the hairdryer but all basic amenities were provided (comb, ear buds, body lotion, towels, yukata, body and hair shampoo). Then I had the Tonkotsu Ramen for dinner and my god it was exceptional. Best chashu I've ever tasted! Charred just the right amount and the broth is light so it's not overwhelming. Decided to try the chocolate lava cake for dessert, the lava itself is quite sweet accompanied with strawberries, the cake itself is not sweet so I suggest eating them together.  Then I've decided to go for a final quick dip before I leave. Discarded my used towel earlier so I had to pay another $3 for a big towel which is fair.  Overall I enjoyed trying different baths especially when dipping into the cold bath after the hot ones, you'll immediately get a rush straight to your head (not for everyone, be cautious). My muscles immediately doesn't ache anymore and the experience is very refreshing.

There‚Äôs also a water cooler outside the baths.  Do note that you are not allowed to take pictures in the dressing room. But i saw one lady trying to snap a picture, so do be aware of your surroundings and kindly remind ignorant people who tries to go against the rules.

43,"I was unfortunate enough to encounter two very loud and selfish women who chatted loudly and non-stop in the Onsen area. I asked a staff to go in to tell them to be quiet. When I returned a few minutes later, those women were still talking and have not softened their voices. Obviously your staff didn‚Äôt deliver the warning sufficiently. When groups check-in, your staff should remind them no talking in the Onsen area and that they will be asked to leave if found to be disturbing the ambience of the area. I noticed several other ladies looked annoyed and stared at them too but were probably too polite to complain.

49,"Writing with deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the services provided by Yunomori Spa's management on the handling of the membership credits after the covid pandemic period. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, when Yunomori spa services were temporarily unavailable and restricted due to government regulations and health concerns, it is disheartening to learn that your company did not provide any notification and proper extension for consumers to utilise expiry credits. As a result, many of us were unable to redeem the services we had paid for, thereby incurring a significant financial loss. I believe it is the responsibility of your reputable brand and spa business to act ethically and fairly, especially in times of unforeseen circumstances like the global pandemic. Failing to provide a reasonable extension to customers is an unfair business practice and demonstrates a lack of consideration for your loyal patrons. As a last resort and after multiple tries to request extension, I have resorted to this review and will be bringing this up with Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) through the dispute process.",Yunomori Onsen & Spa,4.2,Massage spa,"Wednesday, 10 am to 10 pm; Thursday, 10 am to 10 pm; Friday, 10 am to 10 pm; Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm; Sunday, 10 am to 10 pm; Monday, 10 am to 10 pm; Tuesday, 10 am to 10 pm.

57,"Went with my young girl (20 Jun 2023, 2pm). It was pretty exciting to go in, to walk in barefoot, to choose your yutaka... The front desk gentlemen was very friendly so it was a warm welcome. The lady inside explained the rules but done very quickly so took a while to understand for a first timer.  Great points: The spas were wonderful...we loved the: - the onsen experience of taking a shower seated next to your child - the warm water hugging your body and the tiredness all away, leaving us both relaxed and both slept super well at night - the different pools and their texture - a small cafe an option for food, in between our soaks, came out for cake, drinks and fried chicken. We brought some books to read and then took a 5min nap for the fun of it. - the tag that they give you is great too, keeps all your things safe. - Honestly $48 for entry is quite good since most 1hour massages are way more expensive.  What could be improved: - the left side bubble bath one of the individual pods were down and it seems that the remaining 4, 1 was much stronger and shioker than the rest, better if can have all of them of the same consistency - Kids portion for menu would be good like fried chicken or nuggets with fries - more ice cream choices - towel situation: you are given one small towel and a larger towel but you can only bring the smaller one into the shower cum onsen area. Yet you need to dry yourself after your shower before you enter the locker room, which is strange because your large towel you cannot bring into the shower area. Not sure if i misunderstood the rules.  Will i come back? yes if i cannot go a real onsen then i guess this will do but perhaps alone or with another adult who will enjoy a longer soak. though my child did ask me to bring her back..",Yunomori Onsen & Spa,4.2,Massage spa,"Wednesday, 10 am to 10 pm; Thursday, 10 am to 10 pm; Friday, 10 am to 10 pm; Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm; Sunday, 10 am to 10 pm; Monday, 10 am to 10 pm; Tuesday, 10 am to 10 pm.

93,"-was clueless when i saw the no shoes beyond this point sign at the entrance. should state of website to put shoes in lockers provided before checking in. -onsen facilities werent as amazing as i expected, other than the silk bath and steam room, the rest of the baths felt like heated swimming pools, also because of the slight chlorine smell. However considering the affordable price ($40.66) for a whole day, its very worth it. took my time trying out every bath, facilities were very clean and the signs made everything easy to understand! -black disposable bra and underwear provided, dont have to strip naked in the onsen if you dont want to. -went on a monday afternoon and there were around 20 people in the onsen, shower area and locker room. -the staff at both the cafe and onsen were very helpful and friendly, one of the malay cleaner aunties saw me struggling with my obi (yukata sash) and helped me to tie it, i felt so loved 10/10 customer service haha. for a more seamless experience, practice at home before coming. -hair tonic, body lotion, conditioner, hairdryer all provided. -resting lounge was so comfortable that i fell asleep for 1h+ . -I tried the unagi ochazuke ($13 something) and manga smoothie ($6 something) both were delicious, but the ochazuke is not worth it if you are looking for something filling (at least need 2 bowls to feel full). -stayed for about 5 hours with the onsens, eating, and napping. even went back for another dip after my nap, felt so refreshed and relaxed by the time i left, much needed break.  overall, im very satisfied and feel that its definitely a worthwhile experience! affordable price and up-to-standard facilities. however, front desk staff could be more friendly (no eye contact/smile) and could be more first-timer friendly by providing instructions on how to wear the yukata, cafe food is also a little expensive, but delicious.",Yunomori Onsen & Spa,4.2,Massage spa,"Wednesday, 10 am to 10 pm; Thursday, 10 am to 10 pm; Friday, 10 am to 10 pm; Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm; Sunday, 10 am to 10 pm; Monday, 10 am to 10 pm; Tuesday, 10 am to 10 pm.

110,"There are many secrets held in this temple. Beyond its beauty and history, the truth of this temple is the spiritual possibility one can access here. One of the most famous and popular aspect of this temple is the spiritual connection of Yue Lao (Moon Elder). Here is where endless individuals come to pray for help/blessings to meet a serious marriage partner. Everyday, you will find nervous individuals queuing up to petition for one. Something few know is that you can also be asking the very same spiritual connection aka deity for help with good relationship at work! And only recently, I realised personally that you can also ask for help to heal your broken heart. Not to ask to meet someone but just to be healed and it doesn't have to be broken from love relationships. It can be from anything.  Just follow the basic practice of kneeling and announcing your full name out loud (softly under your breath) AND your full birthdate and place of birth. There is more but this shall suffice.

112,"interesting place; replete with restored timber back in the 1990s, bas reliefs and murals are authentic and quite old as well as the effigies of gods used in worship, all beautifully and intricately carved altars in gold paint and the whole outfit is still being looked after by the Ngee Ann Kongsi in Singapore.  I went there to take a look because local internet gossip claimed it as the efficacious ""Temple Of Love"" after a thai national woman said she found her Singaporean husband by appealing to the God of Matchmaking ""Êúà‰Ω¨‚Äú for supernatural assistance.  My profound respects to the Taoist Belief system, and those who venture to these holy places with sincerity with their hearts for a loving worthy mate, BUT i think these people should ask themselves what are they willing to do for such a prospective mate. What are their motivations for wanting such a mate and if they themselves are truly worthy of their ideal mates ( i overheard iterations of Singaporean ""È´òÂØåÂ∏Ö"" for husbands, but statistically not that many around).  I witnessed fathers and mothers with exasperated looks trying to ask the gods to help palm their lacklustre daughters  ( check her dress, attitude, mannerisms, rudeness, and sheer callousness to other worshippers and tourists around them) off on some prospective guy, maybe should pray for gods to make their daughters become ""virtuous wife"" material first as a fair match.  I am also unsure if their daughters prefer partners of a more Sapphic nature -- maybe they should save up a trip to New Taipei City to WeimingTang and ask the Rabbit God for helpüòÖüòÅüåà. There are also many other foreign women wanting to find a local guys as husbands, and one wonders would any local guys do for them as prospective mate, as long as they hold a Singapore Passport?  We can see how it's a tough gig for a God of Matchmaking to balance between fairness for the unwitting prospective mates out there being strung up by YueLao at the behest of these women.  And on behalf of Objectivity and Fairness and every unwitting guy and gal out there, my ardent prayer for all is this:  May Êúà‰Ω¨  find for each and everyone the mate that they deserve, and not necessarily the one that they think are the one that they want!  Perhaps it is better to let genuine values and truth be the basis of true happiness for a relationship be built upon, because i don't think there is a Taoist God of Fair Divorce!

It wasn't too crowded on the Saturday evening we visited, and so the wonderful staff were able to spend more time with every table.  Really appreciated the food and wine recommendations given by our server, and the sous chef Neville who come out and personally explained some of the dishes to us. Amazing that they had such great produce from Australia and their own gardens (you can go around the back and walk through the greenery, try to spot some of the food you ate)!

The taste of the 65‚Äô Florentine egg and truffle was masked by the spinach, but the taste of the spinach was great.  The French onion soup was sweet and thicker which was surprising.  The wagyu striplion was done as a roast and delightful to have with some charring on the sides.  The duck confit was good and not too salty.

On the day itself, he was able to foresee our needs, was on the ball with everything, and well-organised. All the way from ROM to the end of the dinner, we were well taken care of. We would not have been able to do any of it without him! Sara, the event planner who liaised with us, was also a great help.  We loved the wedding so much.

155,"Ambience: 5/5 Food: 2/5 (the REALLY SALTY duck leg confit is quite horrible imo, and it tainted our experience) Service: 4/5  Me and my partner made a reservation here on 28 Jan, 7pm to celebrate our anniversary. I will write a very honest review about our experience here. The area where we were sitted was v nice, beside a beautifully decorated wall of plants. I think these 'nicer' seats are given to ppl who are celebrating special occasions. I appreciate the service crew's effort to sit us there. We ordered the 'communal dining' course meal. There were some good courses and several hit and misses, with ONE VERY TERRIBLE MISS. We especially enjoyed the rye bread with home made butter, and the grilled prawns. The avocado truffle ikura with quinoa crackers was interesting, something new to our taste buds. The starters were pretty solid, so they did build up our anticipation for the mains, only for us to be sorely disappointed. When the duck leg confits were served, we were pretty pumped as they looked visually pleasing. The meat looked tender, and they fell off the bones easily. However, lo and behold, they were REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY!! SALTY!!!!! I am someone who eats salty food, and believe me when I say this is really freaking salty, on another level already. On par with or even possibly surpassing the saltiness of salted egg white. I tried 2 more bites, but it was overwhelmingly salty, so I summoned the courage to bring up the matter to the service crew. I have never complained about food to any service crew before, but this duck confit was the first time I felt a need to. It felt like ingesting spoons of salt with every bite. What I got from the service crew was that 'french food is supposed to be salty'. I attempted to ask for a change in the course meal, but it did not look like it was going to happen as the manager was rather adamant that the food is supposed to be salty, although I am still not convinced it should be THIS salty. The manager offered us more onion sauce to neutralise the saltiness...and because we did not want to make things difficult, despite the really no go duck confit in our opinion, we just suck thumb and eat lor. I tried my best to eat as much as I could cus it's not cheap... So, ORDER AT YOUR DISCRETION... Order only if you know you can eat a whole duck leg size of salted egg white... The elderflower sorbet is really nice tho, IT WAS THE SAVING GRACE. And at last, the crew gave us an on the house red velvet cheesecake to celebrate our anniversary, and that also helped to make the evening a little better, and we do appreciate the effort.  It was not a bad experience overall, bcus it was rather funny trying to finish eating sth so... salty.

156,"It was my first visit to this lovely cosy place tucked away in the quiet (or maybe not so quiet since it's almost at the doorstep of Seletar Airport) estate of Seletar Aerospace Park in the northeastern part of Singapore. It might be a little out of the way for some though.  I had a hot caramel latte (which is kind of like my must-have drink no matter where I dine at) that came with ""love""‚Äîsimple latte art. For the mains, I had soft-shell chilli crab linguine, which turned out to be an absolute delight. If you're up for it, take each spoonful with a bite of the chilli padi. It could be a little too spicy for folks who don't really eat spicy food.  We do, however, have a minor complaint. We had some problems making payment after ordering over their website via a QR code.  If you have time to spare after your meal, do hop over to nearby Hampstead Wetland Park to soak in nature and, after that, head up to Boardwalk@Seletar where you can see the airport runway dotted with small airplanes on the perimeter tracks. You may also catch an airplane or two taking off or landing. As you walk up Hyde Park Gate, you will see several large abandoned, recently or long ago, colonial bungalows, which make for an interesting backdrop for those 'gram shots.

When i request for change of meat from beef, they were able to accommodate. The dishes were nice and filling. The environment was romantic and its lime a private dining room. If only there could be romantic music in the background as well as it does get quiet if no one is talking. There's also a nice garden to walk around after the dinner.

188,"Outstanding service, despite being busy. We were shown to our table promptly but weren't hurried for the duration. A wonderful opportunity to relax and enjoy the delectable cocktail selection!  For anyone unfamiliar, the view of the Marina is spectacular. The music is perfect for the venue.  Only challenge is navigating the national gallery to get there - but worth getting lost for!",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
189,"Great view and fun cocktails.  We ordered a few different types, Singapore sling, moves like jigger, monochrome and woks that smell.  All unique. The woks that smell tasted exactly like woodfire smoke, the moves like jigger came out on a bed of dry ice so was fun to watch steam. Monochrome was probably our least favourite but oddly tasted like paper and graphite.  Good to come for a cocktail - food was average - come for drinks, dine elsewhere",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
190,"Rated as one of the Top bars in Asia, Smoke and mirrors lives up to the hype. The views from top are gorgeous, panning a picturesque view of Marina Bay. The cocktail menu is quirky, with flavors and stories of Singapore weaved in, priced at the higher side of $25 and upwards (which is pretty standard for top bars in Singapore.) An ideal date night place, reservations are mandatory unless you want to chance a walk-in and might get lucky. Food menu is limited to snacky bar food, good for a light nibble with drinks. Staff is polite and friendly and also offered us a birthday drink which was a super sweet gesture. It's a star short in review because while the vibe and view is spot on, cocktails weren't exceptional. Many other speakeasy do a better job, and would have expected a bit more from this place. Still highly recommended to visit and experience.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
191,"My second time at Smoke & Mirrors. Nothing can beat its view - it has the much coveted front row Marina Bay Sands view, and cityscape on both Raffles Place and City Hall areas. Really wonderful view and perfect if you are a views person.  Drinks were quite decent too. Their interesting menu links each of their cocktails with an art piece. You can scan the QR code on the menu to check out the art that inspires your cocktail. Quite a cool experience and connects the guests with the national gallery just downstairs.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
192,"Loved the place .. love the vibe ..Excellent place if u want to celebrate any special occasion. Try and get outside sitting tables if u like sitting outdoor,  view is beautiful üòç Drinks were superb , we tried mostly all of them and all were excellent.! Food wise they are just serving small menu and it‚Äôs good enough to enjoy with drinks . Would definitely recommend this place üëç",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
193,"Came here twice & I really do enjoy their drinks. Only down side is that if you're sitting outside & there's no breeze... Be prepared to sweat. If you're seated inside, some areas don't really get any aircon at all so it can get stuffy. Service & drinks are good, but not super comfortable when you're sweating.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
194,"Fabulous roof top view of the Padang and MBS is worth it. Good cocktails and decent bar bites with a few vegetarian options. Great service, and we received complimentary cocktails for our anniversary celebration.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
195,It was evening. Sun has set. But alas it was still too hot regardless of outdoor or indoor seating. Staff forgot our order and returned to ask for it again. Food took a while to arrive. Cocktails are overpriced. View is over rated.,Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
196,"Very nice cocktail bar. We had a bit of a hard time finding it, but once we were there we enjoyed our time there very much. Our waiter was very kind and attentive, always ready to give recommendations, which I appreciated. Cocktails were great, view is nice.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
197,"Smoke and mirrors has been on my list for a while. While the atmosphere and service were great, I was disappointed with one of the cocktails I ordered. I ordered one of their signature cocktail Beyond The Canyon, but it tasted really bad. There was nothing other than a sour taste, and I couldn't taste any alcohol at all. I even asked my friend to try it, and they agreed that there was no alcohol taste at all. It felt like the alcohol was forgotten to add in, making it the worst drink I've ever had. I was really looking forward to trying this cocktail, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. I hope the bar can improve the quality of their cocktails in the future",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
198,"Loved the drinks. Food, so-so. Service was great! But didn't like where we were seated even if we reserved a table cos we were in a corner.. And just barely 2 feet behind me was a pipe and a waiter station",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

201,"Highly recommend! Great views, delicious and interesting drinks, and good service. We did not reserve and was seated in the indoors lounge area around 5:45 pm on a Sunday, but after we ordered, we were offered a table on the terrace because it was free until 7 pm, which was very appreciated. Not super crowded on a Sunday night and overall the vibe was very chill.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
202,"Delicious & Innovative Cocktails paired with a Great View.  We came here without reservation, but it was no issue. They have ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù and ‚Äúindoor‚Äù area, but really it‚Äôs an open-aired venue. Definitely a common date-night spot or spot for several friends to gather for a good drink. We‚Äôre big cocktail people and we were impressed. If you have a particular style, they‚Äôll point you in the right direction of what will suit your fancy. The menu is also one of those that directs you towards particular styles (boldness, flavor, etc.). Some interesting concepts embedded in their drinks as well. We really liked the tea-inspired cocktail that came as a set of two and only utilized Japanese liquor - pretty unique. Service was superb and we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to return when we come back to Singapore.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

205,Bartenders are so friendly and kind. They are so professional and do great performance when they make the menu. It feels like art not just cocktail. Night view of this bar is so amazing and good to take pictures. I had Moves like Jigger.  Coconut like cup is so interesting and it has its own performance when bartenders make it. Let's enjoy it!,Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
206,"Amazing view of MBS, the bay, and the financial district. Drinks were more than just drinks - they were art. Servers were top notch",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

208,One of the best bars in Singapore. Amazing location. Menu is great. Shoutout to Joshua for being the most amazing bartender. The cocktails he recommended and made for us were too good. Dont miss out on a pink guava based cocktail if you want to have a truly tropical experience. Views are to die for. Highly recommend this place. Thanks Joshua for making it even more special for us.,Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
209,"If you want a good rooftop bar with a really good view I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE!! We were on more rooftop bars and this was the best one. The service was super friendly and the view just wow! You should reserve before, and of course the prices are a little bit higher but I think on all rooftop bars! Really creative cocktails!",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
210,"Smoke and Mirrors, National Gallery: Perched at 60th spot of the Top 50 Asia bars, Smoke and Mirrors is still a crowd favourite for the grandiose  panoramic sweeping view of Marina Bay Sands. What more of the last day of the Night to Light festival - which lights up the entire Padang view. Smoke and Mirrors has that curvy elegant silver bar that is reminiscent of Anish Kapoor‚Äôs Cloud Gate in windy Chicago. If you want the coveted front row seats to a view, book in advance. Wok‚Äôs That Smell, cheekily named is a modern take on wok staples such as fried hor fun sitting on a coaster that shields llapcheog (Chinese sausage) smoke. The whole experience is fun. Although the hor fun could be seasoned with seaweed or seasonings for more of an umami taste. Dry January cocktail dark and spicy tastes straight up like ginger ale but looks good with the sultry lighting. Apart from the strange crowd comprising mostly tourists, this is one classy bar that ticks all the right boxes. #eatstylishtravelstylish",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

212,"It was a really beautiful bar, with amazing view of Marina Bay. Set on top of the national gallery in the civic district, do try to place reservation for the outdoor seats. Do note there is no fan/ air conditioning, so dress accordingly.  The drinks were delightful. Cha cha duet was my first poison of choice - a delightful fruity, tea infused cocktails which turned into three different drinks: recommended for those who like sweet and sour drinks. It was super smooth and went down very easily - highly recommended if you're up for something experimental.  Second drink was monkey god: a rye whiskey based cocktail with a sweet depiction of a yin and yang on a rice sheet, placed on top of the drink. It was refreshing and smooth drink, highly recommended.  Service team was delightful and attentive, regularly checking and topping up our water.  One advice: don't order the fries, the portion was really small :(",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
213,Amazing service & food & drinks!! the view is gorgeous. Been here multiple times. I always hosts my guests from overseas here because I know Smoke & Mirrors won‚Äôt disappoint. Shoutout to Xue Li for always getting us a good table! Will be back soon.,Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
214,"Definitely recommend Wok's That Smell.  You will taste a strong smokey (wokhei) taste at first, followed by a deep sweet and the back of your tongue and finished with a light spiciness lingered at the back of the throat.  However the place is a little warm and this is not a cheap place.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

I will definitely be back simply for that last reason but everything else is a nice bonus.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

Highly recommended.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,
219,"Cool spot for creative cocktails and a chill night. The cocktails were great, with an artsy flair. View was nice looking over the field at the city and Marina Bay.

I would definitely go back.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

The labels on the mocktails can be customized, and they delivered them right on point. Eileen checked in with me after delivery and I mentioned that there was a bit of spillage (which might have been due to delivery which is not their fault). I did not expect it at all, but she offered to replace the ones that had spillage issues and I received the replacements promptly. The team really went above and beyond to ensure that they excel in what they do. Thank you for making my night; it's been a while since I've visited a place with such ethos.

The tempura was very bitter (so much so that I actually didnt finish it), pizza was crispy   but tasted average, and no one pays $12 for avocado as a side!

The drinks were as special as the location - the menu design itself was well done with further information per drink and each one having it's own twist (e.g. a magic trick being performed by the waiter once the drink is served). We additionally ordered food which fit the overall concept of the bar well (not too heavy food, not too light). The view speaks for itself and also the inside design of the bar was well done. Everything being topped up by the great choice of music playlist (70s to 90s) made our evening fabulous.",Smoke & Mirrors,4.3,Bar,

240,"A pretty nice view, though not very high up. Experience marred by unbelievably arrogant staff. Food does not arrive, and then they claim was never ordered, effectively accusing us of lying!

The Rain Occulus water fountain, boat rides within the mall, digital light art, a view of the Singapore skyline, a beautiful waterfront, laser shows at night, huge walking spaces both inside and outside the mall, the Art Science Museum next door, a roof terrace, connecting bridges to the Gardens by the Bay, glass roofs that give you that infinity feeling etc.  For food it has a beautiful food court (it's relatively cheap to other food options but certainly not at normal food court prices but still very affordable). Numerous Michelin Star restaurants as well as high end Omakase dining options are available for the more discerning customer.  There are some very interesting shops that are on the water that are part of the mall. Most of the shopping is high end except for the pharmacies.  There is a lot of parking available but it can be very expensive and crowded especially on days when there are conventions going on. Better to take the train to Bayfront MRT right at the mall on those days. The car parks are well-lit and easy to manoeuvre though  Overall, this is an excellent mall that keeps improving and re-inventing itself. Will be revisiting over and over again to see what's next.",The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands,4.7,Shopping mall,"Wednesday, 10 am to 10 pm; Thursday, 10 am to 10 pm; Friday, 10 am to 10 pm; Saturday, 10 am to 10 pm; Sunday, 10 am to 10 pm; Monday, 10 am to 10 pm; Tuesday, 10 am to 10 pm.

382,"If you enjoy feeding animal. And don't mind the hot and humid weather. This is a prefect place to go. Personally I enjoyed a lot. But not my hubby. Complaining hot, humid and smelly. Hahahhaa..  I enjoyed the feeding session. No entry charge. But you need to pay for the hay at $5/pack. Be careful while feeding as the goat will rush to you and bite the plastic bag as well.  After feeding, you can wash your hand at the toilet, and get some fresh goat milk (original or chocolate at $2.50/bottle) and rest at the picnic table.  It is free parking, ard 10+ parking lot, becareful if u drove big mpv or suv, the road is kinda narrow, cos tour bus will drive ppl in. Hence, it would be challenging to drove in or out or even park there.  Oh they are moving out soon. So do take note.

They have bridges connecting two blocks at some levels, which is a good place to take pictures of the architecture. I admire how they have kids' zone so they can interact with art.

To be honest, I was taken aback with how they asked me for the ticket, weirdly, even with a Singapore Id and that it's free for Singaporeans, they still require the ticket.

I was with my 1.5 year old son at the flight info display flipboard and I was supporting my son while he was standing on the dark green parapet and looking at the flipboard in action. Hafiz suddenly walked towards us with pace and aggressiveness and made a very rude hand gesture to shoo us away without even saying anything. I was taken aback by his action and told him he could have asked us nicely and I would get my son off the parapet but he simply shrugged me off and and claimed that the dark green parapet is ‚Äòartifact‚Äô and let off a condescending laughter before walking off. A family trip was disrupted just like that. The rest of the older security personnels that I met in the museum were wonderful and displayed professionalism and empathy  when speaking to us, I cannot say the same of Hafiz.

But then, at the end of the night, until the restaurant closing.. all those EMPTY Tables just wasted! Could it be all 5-8tables No show? Or the staff just feel it troublesome to change for us?

So, we couldn‚Äôt enjoy our food at once. And some of the dishes, it‚Äôs already not that hot when it was served. We ordered the recommended dishes, the raw beef A5 but there was no way of plating near to the picture of what we saw in the menu. The plating is ridiculous for the pricing that charged the customer. The taste was bland nothing so special or to shout out. Not worth the money. However the bartender service was okay time to time still bother to check on us, not like the service crew that we tried to get their attention but they just totally ignored, walked passed us blindly or just super enjoyed talking to only specific some of the customers. Hope their management will look in through this matter and solve the issues. The atmosphere, decoration is nice. Unfortunately, the services should be all standardized not just based on the staff personal basis.

The staff addressed my name personally. The dishes were very well done as you can see from my picture.

The atmosphere is also fantastic, reservations are difficult need to book in advance. Drinks were awesome too and not too over priced. Similar to what you get elsewhere. Definitely try the sakes.  But frankly that's what you're paying for is that. The food for that price is just average, I think genki sushi does the sashimis and makis better. Some good exceptions were the wagyu tataki, jalapeno ceviche mostly because of the yuzu dressing. The miso eggplant is also good. Lamb chops had no flavour and quite rare. Crispy chicken was not bad though. The mains of black pepper chicken was also average for the price. The desserts were really good though and definitely worth getting some.

We asked for the waitress for food recommendations and she recommended most of the food that we can see in this review section; Unagi Maki roll, Truffle fried rice, uni carbonara etc etc..  Best part is, when we asked for the drinks recommendation, the waitress recommended drinks based on shape of the cup instead of tasting notes. Usually when we ask for recommendations, people tend to focus on sweetness, sourness, level of alcohol etc. But here, she mentioned that ""the cup comes in shape of a bird. if you don't like, you can also take option 3, the cup is in blue color. makes the color of the drink nicer"". erm oks. i'm there for a drink and not to admire the cups, Missey.

Nice place to take photographs. The space was very big with high ceiling, hence very relaxing. Tables were quite near to each other and we could hear the conversation of the next table.

The man challenged the staff and asked ""You don't know what kind of beer you have?"" The staff was very professional and explained to him that it would be easier if her refer to the description.

795,"This is in MBS itself, one of the levels, just beside Marquee. What is interesting is how a small entrance can lead to such a big interior. The Tori gates give you Japanese vibes. Reservations only here. You need to reserve at least a month in advance. When you arrive, you get seated at a waiting area, while they clear your table. Order via the waiters or waitresses. Still water is chargeable. Scan QR code to order menu. Toilet is on 2nd floor (interestingly).  Prices are definitely slightly pricier than usual. The big piece of salmon is around $38 for reference. But they are all very tasty and well cooked.  The interior is really big. There's a large bell with faces, and a bridge, giving the Japan vibes. The only drawback not everyone will appreciate is the dark setting of the restaurant overall, something you need to get used to. There are many tables to seat many customers inside.

The cheesecake was unbelievably good. Yes, the food was good, but was there anything above average that stood out? Not really. You are paying a premium for the environment and ambience.

But both dishes are boring to eat, over al dente and dry. My wife and I did not speak a single word when eating the pasta because we knew the standard is off.

Hostess while waiting for us to order was standing right behind me (at the counter by the door) rapping her knuckles against it repeatedly, which made the experience feel very hurried. Pasta was alright. We got two mid range pastas and two still water ($3/pax) and that set us back almost $100 for a lunch with not much ambience.

1020,"Disclaimer: Rating is solely based on taste of food.  Came on a Friday night at 6.30pm to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. We made a reservation a month in advance ‚Äòcos we saw that a reservation is required for the experience tasting menu, but do note it‚Äôs a different reservation from the normal one (need to pick the specific experience tasting reservation and is available at 8pm seating; and also, the reservation we made was for a normal table seating so we weren‚Äôt able to have the experience tasting).  Somehow, a couple next to us was having the experience menu even though we were at the first seating so we tried our luck with the waitress, who said it wasn‚Äôt available til the second seating and had to be pre-booked in advance (also, making me very confused since the couple next to us was having it during the first seating‚Ä¶ ü§î like how did they book this for the first seating when the website didn‚Äôt have this option? Is it strictly for second seating or can we make a request in advance for the first seating?)  Service crew was very professional and attentive. With the open concept kitchen right in front of us, it was difficult not to have our eyes on the chefs showing off their cooking skills. My husband and I caught one of the ladles dropping on the floor and one of the chef picking it up to hang back in it‚Äôs original place without washing it, and proceeded to scoop (not sure if it‚Äôs broth or water) from a huge pot to cook the pastas. We were mortified‚Ä¶ informed the manager (who was really so professional) and got them to discard the whole pot and remove the ladle for washing. Tbh if I ever came back again it‚Äôll be because of the wonderful service and professionalism from the service crew. üíØ  Moving on to the food, we ordered the pan-seared Hokkaido Scallop ($34), Grilled Mediterranean Octipus ($34), Lumache (lamb ragu; $36) and Sea Urchin Tagliolini ($42).  The size of the antipasti isn‚Äôt too much so we were fortunately able to finish them. The Hokkaido scallop was fresh and good; paired with sweet corn pur√©e, crispy Parma ham and celeriac slaw. It was an interesting combination and the best way to eat this is to have each element in the same bite (somehow eating them separately made me find this dish very weird). Although it was good, I don‚Äôt find this dish exactly impressive.  The Grilled Mediterranean octopus was grilled to the perfect texture. Paired with baby potatoes, black olives, garlic cream and crumbs, I find myself not quite a fan of this dish. Although the octopus texture was good, the other ingredients didn‚Äôt quite complement the octopus. The garlic cream was a tad bitter and the crumbs made this dish drier. Highly recommend skipping this dish.  The Lumache (Lamb Ragu) was slightly gamey but still acceptable. I‚Äôm not a fan of the gamey mutton taste but I could accept the taste of this dish so I would say it‚Äôs considered pretty good. The pasta texture was Al dente and I like how bits of the pasta were charred which gave it an extra texture. Cream was alright, but this dish as a whole wasn‚Äôt exactly impressive, so personally I wouldn‚Äôt order it again.  Lastly, the sea urchin tagliolini which was so highly raved. The sea urchin was fresh, the sauce wasn‚Äôt too jelak and the pasta texture was good (Al dente). However, there were bits of ginger in it which masked the taste of the dish somehow. I felt like I was eating creamy ginger pasta, but I believe the ginger was supposed to prevent the dish from becoming too jelak. Nonetheless, not a fan of this dish.  For the price point and the dishes I‚Äôve had, I would say it‚Äôs not worth coming back. But to be fair, there‚Äôre so many other highly raved dishes that I‚Äôve yet to try such as the Crab Pappardelle, Lobster Ravioli, Tagliatelle (beef ragu) and Truffle Fettucini.

1021,"Really loved the food there, especially the sides. Served up some flavours that were quite unexpected in a good way. Pasta was good too, cooked to the right texture.  The vibe there was really chill too, and the service staff were very friendly and helpful, providing recommendations on the menu too. I really liked the counter seats with the open kitchen, which gave a more intimate experience. Nonetheless, those seats gave me a much closer view of the cooking process, and it freaked me out a little.  I was hoping that the open kitchen would mean that diners could engage with the cooks, but the kitchen staff looked bored, were mostly disengaged, with some using their phones at the counter. It wasn't pleasant watching them work as they looked sloppy. Additionally, I was also a little concerned about hygiene, watching them use ingredients with ungloved hands, face masks hanging over the chin and not on the face, while chatting with each other over a plate of food, etc. This is not something diners would want to see.",Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm.

1022,"The Pasta Bar is all about pastas. obviously, and actually it's more than that. There are pastas of all kinds, and they come with lots of choices of meats or vegetables, like beef, pork, duck, uni, crab, truffle, pumpkin, chickpea and more. So it is one of those times where I have no problem choosing a pasta dish I like due to huge variety of pastas available.  But having good pasta dishes is not enough for me, I need good appetiser and dessert to complete my adventure, and this restaurant fulfils just that. The place is of nice cosy rustic setting with the brick walls, yellow lamps, wine bottle ornaments, juxtaposing with the chic open kitchen counter in the centre of the space. And lots of dry pastas hung around the counter to further emphasise The Pasta Bar has The Pastas. Sitting at the counter is pretty fun since one can watch the chefs in action and witness occasional flamb√©s during the preparation of the pastas.  To complement the great food is the great service here. The service crew takes very good care of us patrons. And good wine recommendation by the young lady staff. It is fruity and refreshing.  Sea Urchin Tagliolini is full of creamy umami due to the sea urchin cream. The cute pieces of sea urchin decked on top of the pasta is very fresh and sweet. So good are the sea urchin that I wish there is more of them added. Tobiko roe gives a nice refreshing element in terms of taste and texture to the pasta. Tagliolini is firm to touch on the surface and soft to bite, in other words, is of perfect texture. The portion of tagliolini is very big, but I can actually finish it due to how satisfying this is on the palates.  I love Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallops here. The scallops with seared surface are so succulent and also briny in taste, accentuated by the mild sweetness of the sweet corn puree and the meaty flavour of crispy Parma ham. I especially like the celeriac slaw added because it is so refreshing in taste and has a nice crunchiness that contrasts well with the other ingredients. A well-executed dish.  The raspberry semi freddo of Raspberry Millefoglie is so good that I totally enjoy just this by itself. The characteristics of raspberry is fine-tuned to the perfect balance of nuanced sweetness, subtle tart taste and soft floral aroma. The puff pastry makes it even better by introducing the crispy, flaky texture and wholesome taste of wheat. Since the semi freddo and savoiardi are frozen, need some brute force to cut out the pieces for savouring. So I suggest letting this dessert sit for a while to thaw a bit for easier handling and richer flavours.  I'm impressed with this place. Now I can see why it is so popular. The portion of the pasta here is big, so if one has concerns about finishing it, either go easy on the prior meal for extra stomach space, or share the pasta dish with appetisers and sides.  For pasta feast, this is the place I will go to.

1024,"Had a celebratory lunch at Pasta Bar and we LOVED the experience! First, we were seated at the counter and was treated to Pasta Bar‚Äôs talented chefs making and cooking pasta. Second, the 3 pastas we ordered were absolutely delicious - cacio e pepe, the ragu and prawn pasta. Our favourite was the prawn, an excellent recommendation by one of the staff. 3 pastas (and no sides) was just nice for the two of us, can‚Äôt wait to be back to try the other dishes.  [Edit] And went back we did on Sun, 11 Jun for the experience menu! The experience menu was a pasta lover‚Äôs dream - we had 4 pasta dishes originating from different parts of Italy with varying sauce bases & meats. We loved it, but do come hungry as the pastas fill up even the most ravenous of eaters really fast. My favourite was the squid ink pasta, with the lobster linguine coming a close second.

Had: - pan seared scallops - pork sausage ragu conchiglie - sea urchin tagliolini.  They were all pretty good. For us, it could do with a pinch less salt.  Others that could be improved: - Complimentary bread would be better if it had some sort of crusty/stone bread or focaccia instead of a ‚Äúgardenia feel‚Äù bread + sea salt on the side to dip alongside the olive oil & vinegar.  - We‚Äôre used to eating Italian in Melbourne which also has chopped chilli in olive oil to add to pasta dishes.

1029,"Visited this unassuming yet stylish restaurant for lunch, where pasta is handmade (!) and hung to dry in the open-kitchen for diners to admire.  Greeted with a welcome serving of bread, as we glanced through what is a decent variety of mains for a Lunch Set Menu (although you don‚Äôt quite have a choice with the Antipasti and Dolce dessert). You have to order bottled water - I was told that tap water is not served here.  Service was excellent, professional, and accommodating. Our request to change one of the Cannolo (which contains Sheep‚Äôs milk ricotta - be warned) was acceded to, with no extra charge. That was a great move as one of us was otherwise aghast with the thought of sheep‚Äôs milk!  The visually-satiating plated burrata appetiser included juicy, refreshing chunks of heirloom tomatoes, and an earthy basil pesto which brought the dish together impeccably. This was ordered out-of-menu; the caesar antipasti was alright, but nothing much to shout about.  Next up are the pasta mains. All three were unique, al-dente, and absolutely delicious. I would rank the creamy Cacio e Pepe first, then the rich beef ragu tagliatelle, and then the (most unique!) crab pappardelle in terms of least adventurous to most. There is a distinct umami flavour in the crab pappardelle - so that made for an interesting savour along with the saffron pairing. That being said, if you are the average pasta person, each of the mains are on the heavier side of things, so you will likely feel ‚Äògelat‚Äô if you aren‚Äôt sharing your mains.  The desserts were even better than the mains, which made for a satisfying conclusion to the lunch. I was chatting with a waitress, and we both agreed that the crisp sheep‚Äôs milk cannolo was much, much tastier than it sounded. The apple strudel was impeccable - highly recommend it.  Two (perhaps fussy) observations - there was noticeable condensation on the restaurant‚Äôs ceiling corners, and air con maintenance conducted during lunch service. Inevitable as maintenance goes, perhaps it could be slightly more subtle, for the price point and ambience.

1032,Was here for a birthday dinner and it was disappointing.  Beef tartare had a great portion of meat but was lacking in capers. It wasn't executed well and didn't have the smoothness from a good beef tartare.  Uni pasta had very little uni and the sauce was done poorly. The pasta clumped together and the whole dish was bad. I'm not sure if it's the cheese or alcohol in it but it made the sauce too sharp/ sour.  Here's a comparison of the uni pasta from 1.5 years ago and now.  The service was good.

1034,"This date night favourite may not have a distinctive name but Pasta Bar sure delivers. Their $30+ pastas pack so much flavour in their delicate portions that the 2 of us didn't regret splurging on 3 pastas during our exclusive night out here.  Crab parpadelle ($36) ü¶Ä 5/5  This was the star of the night, and could be found on everyone's bar counter. The pasta looks strikingly jaundiced but don't be put off! Its colour probably has something to do with its deeply umami flavour. This was so unique we should have ordered 3 of these.  Tagiatelle ($34) üçù 4/5  We thought we should get a pasta with a little meat so we ordered this tagiatelle full of tender, thick clumps of pulled beef. Definitely a delight for the senses but it couldn't beat the crab.  Ciriole carbonara ($34) ü•ì 4/5  We were greedy for a third so we tried the ever-safe choice of carbonara. The ciriole sure was thick and chewy and definitely lent a unique house-made dimension to this dish.

1036,"Pasta Bar is a popular restaurant that specializes in serving freshly made pasta dishes. The restaurant's ambiance is modern and relaxed, making it a great spot for a meal with friends or family.  The quality of the pasta dishes is amazing, noting that the pasta is cooked al dente and the sauces are flavorful and well-balanced. In addition to their pasta dishes, the restaurant also offers a variety of appetizers and desserts.  For our visit, we ordered Wagyu beef carpaccio for the antipasti. Thinly sliced wagyu beef topped with sea urchin mayo, yuzu gel, pickled cucumber, seaweed dressing, and caviar. With the combination of all these ingredients in a single bite, it tastes complex, layered flavor profile with a variety of textures. It is so amazing! The wagyu beef carpaccio is priced at $36.  For the pasta, we ordered the Truffle Fettuccini. Freshly cooked al dente fettuccini topped with parmigiano and generous amount of fresh shaved winter black truffle! Hands down, it is one of the best truffle fettuccini you could get in Singapore. The truffle fettuccini is priced at $46  We wanted to order Sea Urchin Tagliolini. However, they don't have it on that day. Hence, we ordered the Lobster Ravioli. The lobster ravioli has a very nice texture, the taste is rich with the lobster flavor.

However, as you progress along the pasta flavour felt a little flat as it cools down. Dessert (Sicilian Cannolo) has a shell which was fried a little tad too oily for my liking. Service was great and it is wonderful. Perhaps it was the set lunch menu and the food just felt a little underwhelming.

1039,"I‚Äôll split this review into three parts: 1. Food 2. Service 3. Hygiene  Food - the scallops were very tasty and well seasoned, but just a tad cold by the time it reached our table. That being said, it was still the best dish of the night. The broccolini was simple, fragrant and crunchy; not much to complain about. The pasta was however, honestly quite disappointing. Despite the name, the pastas did not have enough shine to be the main star of the night. We had the Rigatoni alla Norma and the Prawn Spaghetti alla Chiatarra. The rigatoni was still a teeny bit raw, but the eggplant with the sauce was good. The prawn spaghetti was unfortunately too salty, and the sauce just seemed like a random mish mash with no distinctive layers.  Service - the service was great, which is why i still gave this two stars  Hygiene - the chefs had their masks down, which is fine given that they are working in a kitchen, but one of the chefs did not even wear gloves, and was coughing and sneezing without covering his mouth/nose, and used the same hand to season the food he cooks. To me that‚Äôs quite a turn off even if the food is really good",Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm.

1040,"I had the experience menu on Monday 27th February 2023.  It is very convenient to get to, a short walk from Outram mrt. When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff.  We had 3 appetisers to start with, everyone of them immaculately crafted by the chefs and bringing a big punch of flavour. If it wasn't for the fact that I had 4 more pastas coming up, I would have asked for seconds.  For the pastas we were given 4 different pasta that all brought their own unique flavours. I never thought that pasta could come with such different dimensions of flavours. The pasta was al Dante, texture was perfect.  My favourite had to be the cheese wheel pasta with pork cheek. Anyway there are 26 different pastas from the menu to choose from and I can't wait to try them all.  The dessert was a DIY canollo set that came with prosecco and lemnocelli sorbet to add a refreshing finish to it.

1041,Lobster Linguine had one of the worst mushy after taste.  Duck Agnolotti portion was small and there wasn‚Äôt really any duck aroma. Portion was small.

1043,"Came here during Christmas, we made our reservations like two months before we came here. Was strange because it was not so crowded around Keong Saik Road, possibly all Singaporean families decided to stay at home due to rising cost and defaulted menu(means restaurant usually give u a Christmas menu to choose from). But this pasta bar is not doing that, which makes me happy.  Service is delightful, it was full-house. Chef even offered us to help get us a photo.  The pasta is al-dente. Uni is fresh, pasta texture is good, creamy with umami flavour. We also like the ravioli, and the grilled octopus. House pour is also good it goes along with the food. Seafood must go with White wines although you can also order red.  Price is steep because of the premium ingredients as expected.  You can chill at this bar and get entertained by the chefs cooking in the kitchen. It sort of become another entertainment besides speaking to your partner.

1044,"The food and service at Pasta Bar are top-notch.  I was seated in front of the open kitchen where I could observe the chefs whip up the pasta dishes. When my server noticed that my bag was a little too bulky, she offered to shift it to another chair. I was also rather impressed that for the still water, a choice of citrus garnish (orange, lemon, lime or grapefruit) is offered. As I was celebrating a friend's birthday, they gifted my friend a bag of fresh pasta, and I thought this was a nice gesture.  For starters, I got the pan seared Hokkaido scallops ($34). The scallops were so juicy and went well with the sweet corn puree. The parma ham was also very crispy and its flavours contrasted well with the crunchy celeraic slaw. This is one dish with various flavours and textures that keeps you coming back for more.  For my main, I got the Ciriole Carbonara ($34). The pasta was cooked al dente. The guanciale was fried till it was crispy which gave it a nice crunch. Unfortunately I found the guanciale a little too salty.  But overall, I loved that this is one of the few places where you can get authentic carbonara.  As a side, I got the grilled asparagus ($16). The stalks of asparagus were so tender. The bits of hazelnuts also added a nice crunch to the dish. But the star of the show was the garlic and anchovies puree atop the asparagus, which provided a good umami dimension to the dish.",Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm.

The burrata here is more expensive than other places as it is a bigger portion, but honestly who doesn‚Äôt want more burrata?  The carbonara comes with meat that is slightly on the saltier side which was surprisingly really good as it cuts through the thick creamy carbonara sauce.

If you have yet to visit, DO MAKE RESERVATIONS as the restaurant is usually packed with diners.  If your go to starter is burrata, why not give their fresh whipped buffalo milk a try and let the natural sweetness take you on a journey.  Up for some wild game? How about the duck rigatoni that was just the right balance on the palate.  Carbonara is a crowd favourite and this fully aims to please. Stepping away from the egg and cream sauce, the fresh pasta coated in a light  cheese based sauce rounded up the meals nicely with the wild mushrooms and crispy salty bacon bits.

Waiter went in, walked around, served other people, did not seem to be checking on tables until I went in and asked again, only then did she lead us to table.  Got seated at the worst possible seat, next to the open kitchen fan where fumes came out even though there were about 10 other seats left.  Chef was sniffing on his own pasta before cooking, as if he was checking if it went bad.

We got the crab pasta and beef ragu pasta, both were excellent - pasta cooked perfectly and beautiful texture. Crab pasta was flavourful and there were enough crab bits in it. It could get a bit too heavy after a while due to such a strong flavour, but it was still really good. The beef ragu was really nice, with enough ragu too.  The price here is a bit on the higher end, but i think for the quality of food you get, it is worth it. Take note that you are charged for water per head, and there's no option of tap water.

1067,"Inconsistent quality. Pasta was served much too watery, especially as compared to my previous visit a mere three weeks prior.  It also seems that in those three weeks, practically the entire staff had been replaced by new hires, and the standard of operations took a significant hit in the process.  An example of a regression would be the fact that in my previous visit I was offered to taste my ordered wine before it was served. This time, it was served without a confirmation, and was poured haphazardly (some wine spilled!)  While I personally did not have to wait too long for my reserved table (5-10 mins), a customer ahead of me was forced to wait fifteen minutes to get their table, and a significant backlog of waiting patrons seemed to have been built.

1069,"Extremely pleased with the food we had at Pasta Bar.  They have a wide variety of pasta dishes, making it hard for us to decide which to try.  We ordered one starter, two mains, and one dessert.  Grilled Mediterranean Octopus Octopus was well-cooked, and the texture was great. The garlic cream and crumbs did not overpower the flavour of the octopus.  Duck Agnolotti My husband's fav dish. There was a hint of truffle that did not overpower the duck flavour. Each ravioli was stuffed with generous duck confit, which was extremely flavourful. I could taste the fattiness within the duck with each bite.  Prawn spaghetti alla Chiatarra This was my fav dish. The pasta was perfect and al dente. Went really well with the seafood sauce. We ran out of bread and the restaurant manager gave us extra bread to finish the sauce!  Sicilian Cannolo First time trying. Surprisingly light for sheep cheese and went well with the crust and pistachio. Overall, a nice way to end the meal, but nothing extra-ordinary.  Overall, i'll give it a 4 out of 5, with certain areas for improvement. - Making reservations may get mildly stressful as they neither pick up phone calls nor reply to FB & IG messages. The manager did say that they will reply to emails so i'll recommend to email them if you have issues with booking. - They also did not pick up the note I indicated when i booked - that this was for an anniversary dinner. So the dessert did not come with any greetings. Thought it would have been a nice gesture if they did.  Will still return again to try the other pastas!",Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm.

1071,"Came here ytd for lunch based on recommendation from a friend. We were seated at the bar counter, almost near to the corner, under the aircon. There was a condensation that dripped once onto my shoulder. Forgotten to mention to the staff after my lunch, so hopefully something could be done. But it was all okay - everything smelt so good from the chefs' cooking that made me forget about it.  Staff in general were friendly and attentive. Service was good. They constantly checked in with us on the food etc. We ordered the beef ragu pasta, Lobster Ravioli, grilled asparagus and the raspberry dessert. Prices could be on a high side but the food was to our liking! Pasta tasted fresh and al dente. Although I personally preferred the asparagus to be grilled further but the brown sauce and nuts were a good pairing! In addition for wine, we have enjoyed the Savignon Blanc and the Chianti.  I would also like to extend sincere thanks to the chefs who gave us an opportunity to try the Crab Fettuccine, which was good! Cream was just nice, not too overdone (There's this taste of sea).

1072,"I came here for the pasta, and I ended up leaving having made a new friend named Nic. TL;DR This is some of the best food and hospitality I‚Äôve experienced in a long time. Pasta Bar has rightfully earned its following.  If you‚Äôre one for theatrics (or simply have pyromaniac tendencies), please have a seat at the bar if you can. The chefs whip up absolute magic before your very eyes and it‚Äôs quite a sight.  The scallops were absolutely mind blowing. I‚Äôm not one for corn but the base of pur√©ed corn; that surprising creaminess paired with the sweetness of the scallops contrasted well with the shards of crispy, salty Parma ham. Flavors and textures I never thought possible on a mere plate, truly to die for.  Whenever I‚Äôm here, burrata and tagliatelle is the way to go. The pasta is Al dente and bites back in the best way possible. With a rich ragu that‚Äôs been so cooked for so long, it is too tender and clings to the noodles for dear life.  And to Nic, thank you for your warm hospitality and the little bag of precious, handmade pasta to take home.

1075,"With an array of hand made pasta shapes and flavours, the restaurant spoils you for choice. Some choices however, are better than others. Go for the Lumache and Saffron Crab Papparadelle, the others are far too salty. While the Reginetta entices with its ruffles and the Pici holds its sauce well, the combination of heavy handed oiling and multiple salty ingredients overshadows what could be a delicious textural experience. Simple, rustic and hearty, is what pasta should be. The style here seems more northern, with nary a tomato in sight except for the beef tagliatelle which seemed too commonplace to order but may try if a return visit is made.

1130,"Was at the Esplanade for a show and it was amazing. Had a great view from Circle 3, though the banister did obstruct the view a little, but for safety sake I get it.  However the experience was almost ruined by one of the ushers on Circle 3 who treated my friends and I with such disdain and rudeness. Is it because we had coloured hair and visible tattoos? Didn't expect the older generation to still retain such outdated views that people with coloured hair and tattoos are troublemakers.  If any of you have visible tattoos or coloured hair, I highly recommend NOT going unless you want to be snapped at by the ushers.","Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, Singapore",4.6,Performing arts theater,

Beautiful, posh place, easily accessible via basement carpark or public transportation.  We had balcony seats again which were comfortable, cushioned armchairs that were totally movable and easy to position for a better view.  The Theater Staff and Ushers were helpful and very friendly.  My only grouse is that the balcony seats on both Circle 2 & 3 are not accessible by the elevators and we had to use stairs, which would be a challenge for patrons who have difficulties maneuvering up or down the stairs.","Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, Singapore",4.6,Performing arts theater,

1175,2 thumbs up for the place. At first I thought only a few hours would be enough but then we spent time here all day and my child had so much fun. Recommend for Mirror maze and phobia zone,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1176,Educational and fun public space where young ones can learn science concepts visually while enjoying themselves. We particularly love the Butterfly up-close section (additional ticketing fee required) even though the space was small but packed with variety of butterflies. The maze was fun and easy to navigate. We only wish that the water playground could open a bit longer in the evening because of the scorching sun during late morning and afternoon.,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1177,"Went there at Wednesday morning and bought the tickets at the entrance using iPhone. No Apple Pay, need to enter your card information. It will send QR codes to your email. One person per QR code. I was there at 9:57. Not too crowd before 10:40.  There are water play areas right next the the entrance. But we didn‚Äôt get to play in it since it was raining in the afternoon and they closed the feature.  It‚Äôs the best science center I ever been. With just regular entrance free, you can play mirror maze, typhoon simulator, earthquake simulator unlimited times.  There are shows, one is in the middle of the circle, one is at second floor robots show and fire tornados.  We spend 5 dollars extra for the lazer maze. You can play twice per ticket. The laser maze is suitable for 7up. Little kids is kinda waste of money.  We encountered couple school field trips. At least 4 tour bus. But it still manageable. Not feeling too crowed.  Restroom every where. Water fountain not working. Food court sell some hot foods.  Definitely worth to go as a tourist. My 6 and almost 10 year old sons enjoyed it. We stayed there for the whole day.  The only downside is that they don‚Äôt have physical map. And the digital one is really not a good UI for your iPhone,super hard to find your way.  If you bought an adult ticket, there is a 5 dollar shop voucher. Not for using it to buy food or drink.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1178,"Is bigger than I thought! Not enough to cover in 2 hour if you really do all the activities. $6 for adult and $4 for child is definitely very value for money.  There are various show at different timing.  Open carpark outside can get hot and troublesome if rain.  There is stroller for rent at $6 or free for member.  There is a small eateries that sell local food like mee siam, macaroni coffee and sandwich for quick bite.  Another proper restaurant call stellar kitchen outside at main entrance.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1179,"Kids loved the butterfly garden where butterflies could land on them, the place is huge so 2.5hours was not enough!  1140am there was a show on second floor And 12nn had an excellent show with a wonderfully engaging presenter !  Well done Science Centre It‚Äôs tough for those in the east side to come but glad we did and we must bring water gear to play in the outdoor water playground after!  We came on mar school hols",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1180,"Educational and fun for all ages! My uni friends and I had a blast here exploring all of their tinkering eorkshops, exhibits, and activities.  Friends and family can definitely spend their whole afternoon here. We find that 3 hours still isn't enough!  The entrance has many optical illusions which they helpfully explain. You can take many silly photos here and learn these visual phenomenons.  Their tinkering workshop lets you build your own graphic cubes, hot air balloons, and marble pathways which is so interesting! They supervise your glue gun and drill usage so it is very safe.  Their phobia exhibit is short but fun. I especially like their scream booth and their clowns!  Their mirror maze is a must-see! Fun to get lost inside for the kids.  They also have a poop exhibition, cryogenics (must pay), climate change, electricity, and many more.  I think their dialogue with time is also very fun to accept ageing and raise awareness. Ageism is real in Singapore!  Their biology segment could use some work. No one was there cause it was all boring infographics and no actual interactive activities! Their VR segment was cool but it was meh compared to other exhibits.  Some machines and activities are not working which is a bit of a pity too!  Outside, their kinetic garden is very pretty and you can produce musical notes with just some pipes and a slipper üòú.  Definitely come here on a weekday for FREE entry, or during the weekends since its so cheap anyways!",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1181,"A great place to be for all kids. Plenty to see, learn and experience. Staff are all very friendly and helpful.  Thank you for putting up 2 signboards near the entrance. I  understand they were put up about a month ago.  I snapped photos of the 2 signboards - one showing a sitemap ( helped guide me around the place at ease) and the other one showing highlights of activities held at each hall.

1188,"Interactive science centre.This review is for the centre only and not kidsSTOP. Had brought kids here a few times this year to the Science centre and it was fuss-free to enter without any queue even on a weekend. They have several exhibitions going on and a few permanent exhibits that we will see everytime. A few we enjoyed are ""Dialogue with time-Embrace Ageing"" ,  ""Earth alive"" and ""Know your poo"". The kids enjoyed the Waterworks playground too,which is also included as part of the admission ticket. Overall,an enjoyable and fun day trip to the science centre.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1189,"I booked in for the science centre, kids stop and movie show.  My kids ages are 8, 6 and 5 months. We got there about 12pm and left at 5pm.  1. There was so much to do that 5hrs was still not enough. 2. Shame that it was a rainy day, so we missed out on the water play area. Truth is, we have to get there at 10am opening time to be able enjoy and not rush through everything. 3. Love the fact that the museum is engaging  for all different age groups. 4. I was busy feeding my baby so the staff at kids stop looked out and entertain my 6 year old and making sure she was safe. 5. For the Omni theater, I booked '3 2 1 lift off' because it's cartoon. I've seen parents with little kids that booked nature or planets, they came out of the theater earlier. Think about what your kids want instead of yourself.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1190,You should spend min half day to explore the whole center - multi entry allows so you can go to snow city or omni theater in between,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1191,A great and educational day out for the whole family.  It's better to block out a whole day for this visit as there is a lot of content alongside the optional movie and butterfly garden.  The Kinetic Garden outside the Science Center deserves it's own special mention at an attraction.  Worth a visit for budding kids interested in STEM or even adults who geek out on tech.,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,

1193,"Been here many times, and the place starts to feel dated as you see most of he same exhibits each time. For first timers, surely this place will excite you and there is lots to learn surely.

1200,"Don't expect to see scientific breakthroughs or seminal discoveries.  This aging place is one of the few places in Jurong that have seen better days.  Archaic and uninspiring displays provide little educational or inspirational opportunities. Perhaps low - or no-cost tour operators still find this place useful.  For parents of today's internet savvy kids, the value of a visit is doubtful.  The good news is that the place is due for a move - sideways.  Hopefully, a makeover will ensue.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1201,"Visiting from Canada. This is one of the best science centres I've visited. It seems particularly well suited to science instruction, not just visits for curiosity. Well laid out with lots of space, and room between the exhibits, which are well constructed. A good distribution of eating places and restrooms to allow for school groups. The topics are well handled with solid strategies to engage students, and there are sections upstairs for particular instructional activities. Best to get tickets online in advance, although we got excellent help from the service office as we hadn't. A good place to visit if you like science, are interested in science education, or have kids of any age. There's also an excellent location (Stellar is its name and is its quality) if you need a place to have a bite or drink away from all the excitement.

1206,Worth the value especially if you are Singaporean or PR as it's free. For tourists it's $12 for adults and kids above 12 and $8 for kids. We had a great time. The only thing that was not free was the laser maze. We spent all day here.,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1207,Many experiences for children. Too bad centre closing time is 5pm but most exhibits closed for entry by 4.45pm. Not sure if this is proper operations happening at a paid attraction if you're paying for closure at 5pm.,Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1208,"Science center is an amazing place to visit always. Not sure about about the new system though. The only way to get in are through online tickets. Even the individual attractions inside.

1210,"The centre itself is really good esp the Tesla coils, the mirror maze and climate zone. Fear zone is also great.  The big negative is ticket booking. You can‚Äôt buy tickets there.

We had to buy again from official site and those chaps haven‚Äôt refunded either.",Science Centre Singapore,4.4,Science museum,
1211,"Surprisingly great exhibits and very large grounds even for adults, I liked a lot of the urbanism and architecture exhibits.
