"Most Beautiful Mall in Singapore  This is a mall that certainly focuses on visitor experience and makes you want to repeatedly return to.  It has so many things to offer other than high end shopping and food. The Rain Occulus water fountain, boat rides within the mall, digital light art, a view of the Singapore skyline, a beautiful waterfront, laser shows at night, huge walking spaces both inside and outside the mall, the Art Science Museum next door, a roof terrace, connecting bridges to the Gardens by the Bay, glass roofs that give you that infinity feeling etc.  For food it has a beautiful food court (it's relatively cheap to other food options but certainly not at normal food court prices but still very affordable). Numerous Michelin Star restaurants as well as high end Omakase dining options are available for the more discerning customer.  There are some very interesting shops that are on the water that are part of the mall. Most of the shopping is high end except for the pharmacies.  There is a lot of parking available but it can be very expensive and crowded especially on days when there are conventions going on. Better to take the train to Bayfront MRT right at the mall on those days.

"Disclaimer: Rating is solely based on taste of food.  Came on a Friday night at 6.30pm to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. We made a reservation a month in advance ‚Äòcos we saw that a reservation is required for the experience tasting menu, but do note it‚Äôs a different reservation from the normal one (need to pick the specific experience tasting reservation and is available at 8pm seating; and also, the reservation we made was for a normal table seating so we weren‚Äôt able to have the experience tasting).  Somehow, a couple next to us was having the experience menu even though we were at the first seating so we tried our luck with the waitress, who said it wasn‚Äôt available til the second seating and had to be pre-booked in advance (also, making me very confused since the couple next to us was having it during the first seating‚Ä¶ ü§î like how did they book this for the first seating when the website didn‚Äôt have this option? Is it strictly for second seating or can we make a request in advance for the first seating?)  Service crew was very professional and attentive. With the open concept kitchen right in front of us, it was difficult not to have our eyes on the chefs showing off their cooking skills. My husband and I caught one of the ladles dropping on the floor and one of the chef picking it up to hang back in it‚Äôs original place without washing it, and proceeded to scoop (not sure if it‚Äôs broth or water) from a huge pot to cook the pastas. We were mortified‚Ä¶ informed the manager (who was really so professional) and got them to discard the whole pot and remove the ladle for washing. Tbh if I ever came back again it‚Äôll be because of the wonderful service and professionalism from the service crew. üíØ  Moving on to the food, we ordered the pan-seared Hokkaido Scallop ($34), Grilled Mediterranean Octipus ($34), Lumache (lamb ragu; $36) and Sea Urchin Tagliolini ($42).  The size of the antipasti isn‚Äôt too much so we were fortunately able to finish them. The Hokkaido scallop was fresh and good; paired with sweet corn pur√©e, crispy Parma ham and celeriac slaw. It was an interesting combination and the best way to eat this is to have each element in the same bite (somehow eating them separately made me find this dish very weird). Although it was good, I don‚Äôt find this dish exactly impressive.  The Grilled Mediterranean octopus was grilled to the perfect texture. Paired with baby potatoes, black olives, garlic cream and crumbs, I find myself not quite a fan of this dish. Although the octopus texture was good, the other ingredients didn‚Äôt quite complement the octopus. The garlic cream was a tad bitter and the crumbs made this dish drier. Highly recommend skipping this dish.  The Lumache (Lamb Ragu) was slightly gamey but still acceptable. I‚Äôm not a fan of the gamey mutton taste but I could accept the taste of this dish so I would say it‚Äôs considered pretty good. The pasta texture was Al dente and I like how bits of the pasta were charred which gave it an extra texture. Cream was alright, but this dish as a whole wasn‚Äôt exactly impressive, so personally I wouldn‚Äôt order it again.  Lastly, the sea urchin tagliolini which was so highly raved. The sea urchin was fresh, the sauce wasn‚Äôt too jelak and the pasta texture was good (Al dente). However, there were bits of ginger in it which masked the taste of the dish somehow. I felt like I was eating creamy ginger pasta, but I believe the ginger was supposed to prevent the dish from becoming too jelak. Nonetheless, not a fan of this dish.  For the price point and the dishes I‚Äôve had, I would say it‚Äôs not worth coming back. But to be fair, there‚Äôre so many other highly raved dishes that I‚Äôve yet to try such as the Crab Pappardelle, Lobster Ravioli, Tagliatelle (beef ragu) and Truffle Fettucini. And of course the experience menu.

"Really loved the food there, especially the sides. Served up some flavours that were quite unexpected in a good way. Pasta was good too, cooked to the right texture.  The vibe there was really chill too, and the service staff were very friendly and helpful, providing recommendations on the menu too. I really liked the counter seats with the open kitchen, which gave a more intimate experience. Nonetheless, those seats gave me a much closer view of the cooking process, and it freaked me out a little.  I was hoping that the open kitchen would mean that diners could engage with the cooks, but the kitchen staff looked bored, were mostly disengaged, with some using their phones at the counter. It wasn't pleasant watching them work as they looked sloppy. Additionally, I was also a little concerned about hygiene, watching them use ingredients with ungloved hands, face masks hanging over the chin and not on the face, while chatting with each other over a plate of food, etc. This is not something diners would want to see.",4 months ago,2023-07-17 14:49:30.457665,4.0,231,Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm; Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm.

"The Pasta Bar is all about pastas. obviously, and actually it's more than that. There are pastas of all kinds, and they come with lots of choices of meats or vegetables, like beef, pork, duck, uni, crab, truffle, pumpkin, chickpea and more. So it is one of those times where I have no problem choosing a pasta dish I like due to huge variety of pastas available.  But having good pasta dishes is not enough for me, I need good appetiser and dessert to complete my adventure, and this restaurant fulfils just that. The place is of nice cosy rustic setting with the brick walls, yellow lamps, wine bottle ornaments, juxtaposing with the chic open kitchen counter in the centre of the space. And lots of dry pastas hung around the counter to further emphasise The Pasta Bar has The Pastas. Sitting at the counter is pretty fun since one can watch the chefs in action and witness occasional flamb√©s during the preparation of the pastas.  To complement the great food is the great service here. The service crew takes very good care of us patrons. And good wine recommendation by the young lady staff. It is fruity and refreshing.  Sea Urchin Tagliolini is full of creamy umami due to the sea urchin cream. The cute pieces of sea urchin decked on top of the pasta is very fresh and sweet. So good are the sea urchin that I wish there is more of them added. Tobiko roe gives a nice refreshing element in terms of taste and texture to the pasta. Tagliolini is firm to touch on the surface and soft to bite, in other words, is of perfect texture. The portion of tagliolini is very big, but I can actually finish it due to how satisfying this is on the palates.  I love Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallops here. The scallops with seared surface are so succulent and also briny in taste, accentuated by the mild sweetness of the sweet corn puree and the meaty flavour of crispy Parma ham. I especially like the celeriac slaw added because it is so refreshing in taste and has a nice crunchiness that contrasts well with the other ingredients. A well-executed dish.  The raspberry semi freddo of Raspberry Millefoglie is so good that I totally enjoy just this by itself. The characteristics of raspberry is fine-tuned to the perfect balance of nuanced sweetness, subtle tart taste and soft floral aroma. The puff pastry makes it even better by introducing the crispy, flaky texture and wholesome taste of wheat. Since the semi freddo and savoiardi are frozen, need some brute force to cut out the pieces for savouring. So I suggest letting this dessert sit for a while to thaw a bit for easier handling and richer flavours.  I'm impressed with this place. Now I can see why it is so popular. The portion of the pasta here is big, so if one has concerns about finishing it, either go easy on the prior meal for extra stomach space, or share the pasta dish with appetisers and sides.  For pasta feast, this is the place I will go to.

"Had a celebratory lunch at Pasta Bar and we LOVED the experience! First, we were seated at the counter and was treated to Pasta Bar‚Äôs talented chefs making and cooking pasta.

"I‚Äôll split this review into three parts: 1. Food 2. Service 3. Hygiene  Food - the scallops were very tasty and well seasoned, but just a tad cold by the time it reached our table. That being said, it was still the best dish of the night. The broccolini was simple, fragrant and crunchy; not much to complain about. The pasta was however, honestly quite disappointing. Despite the name, the pastas did not have enough shine to be the main star of the night. We had the Rigatoni alla Norma and the Prawn Spaghetti alla Chiatarra. The rigatoni was still a teeny bit raw, but the eggplant with the sauce was good. The prawn spaghetti was unfortunately too salty, and the sauce just seemed like a random mish mash with no distinctive layers.  Service - the service was great, which is why i still gave this two stars  Hygiene - the chefs had their masks down, which is fine given that they are working in a kitchen, but one of the chefs did not even wear gloves, and was coughing and sneezing without covering his mouth/nose, and used the same hand to season the food he cooks. To me that‚Äôs quite a turn off even if the food is really good",6 months ago,2023-07-17 14:50:15.595660,2.0,0,Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm; Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm.

"I had the experience menu on Monday 27th February 2023.  It is very convenient to get to, a short walk from Outram mrt. When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly and welcoming staff.  We had 3 appetisers to start with, everyone of them immaculately crafted by the chefs and bringing a big punch of flavour. If it wasn't for the fact that I had 4 more pastas coming up, I would have asked for seconds.  For the pastas we were given 4 different pasta that all brought their own unique flavours. I never thought that pasta could come with such different dimensions of flavours. The pasta was al Dante, texture was perfect.  My favourite had to be the cheese wheel pasta with pork cheek. Anyway there are 26 different pastas from the menu to choose from and I can't wait to try them all.  The dessert was a DIY canollo set that came with prosecco and lemnocelli sorbet to add a refreshing finish to it.

Lobster Linguine had one of the worst mushy after taste.  Duck Agnolotti portion was small and there wasn‚Äôt really any duck aroma. Portion was small.

"Came here during Christmas, we made our reservations like two months before we came here. Was strange because it was not so crowded around Keong Saik Road, possibly all Singaporean families decided to stay at home due to rising cost and defaulted menu(means restaurant usually give u a Christmas menu to choose from). But this pasta bar is not doing that, which makes me happy.  Service is delightful, it was full-house. Chef even offered us to help get us a photo.  The pasta is al-dente. Uni is fresh, pasta texture is good, creamy with umami flavour. We also like the ravioli, and the grilled octopus. House pour is also good it goes along with the food. Seafood must go with White wines although you can also order red.  Price is steep because of the premium ingredients as expected.

"The food and service at Pasta Bar are top-notch.  I was seated in front of the open kitchen where I could observe the chefs whip up the pasta dishes. When my server noticed that my bag was a little too bulky, she offered to shift it to another chair. I was also rather impressed that for the still water, a choice of citrus garnish (orange, lemon, lime or grapefruit) is offered. As I was celebrating a friend's birthday, they gifted my friend a bag of fresh pasta, and I thought this was a nice gesture.  For starters, I got the pan seared Hokkaido scallops ($34). The scallops were so juicy and went well with the sweet corn puree. The parma ham was also very crispy and its flavours contrasted well with the crunchy celeraic slaw. This is one dish with various flavours and textures that keeps you coming back for more.  For my main, I got the Ciriole Carbonara ($34). The pasta was cooked al dente. The guanciale was fried till it was crispy which gave it a nice crunch. Unfortunately I found the guanciale a little too salty.  But overall, I loved that this is one of the few places where you can get authentic carbonara.  As a side, I got the grilled asparagus ($16). The stalks of asparagus were so tender. The bits of hazelnuts also added a nice crunch to the dish. But the star of the show was the garlic and anchovies puree atop the asparagus, which provided a good umami dimension to the dish.",5 months ago,2023-07-17 14:50:15.596549,5.0,784,Pasta Bar,4.2,Italian restaurant,"Monday, 6 to 11 pm; Tuesday, 6 to 11 pm; Wednesday, 6 to 11 pm; Thursday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Friday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Saturday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm; Sunday, 12 to 3 pm, 6 to 11 pm.

"Well-thought out interior and ambience that allows diners to watch the chefs in action as their meals get prepared.  The burrata here is more expensive than other places as it is a bigger portion, but honestly who doesn‚Äôt want more burrata?  The carbonara comes with meat that is slightly on the saltier side which was surprisingly really good as it cuts through the thick creamy carbonara sauce.

What sets ION Orchard apart from other shopping malls is its dedication to providing an excellent customer experience. The staff members are friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to assist. The mall is immaculately maintained, and the cleanliness and attention to detail contribute to a pleasant and comfortable shopping environment.  One of the highlights of my visit to ION Orchard was the breathtaking view from its rooftop garden, ION Sky. It offers a panoramic vista of Singapore's skyline and is the perfect spot to relax and unwind amidst the bustling city below. The garden is beautifully landscaped, creating a tranquil oasis in the heart of the city.  Lastly, I must mention the seamless connectivity of ION Orchard. It is conveniently linked to an MRT station, making it easily accessible for both locals and tourists. The mall also offers a wide range of amenities, including restrooms, nursing rooms, and complimentary Wi-Fi, further enhancing the overall convenience and comfort for visitors.

"I'd say that walking by the beach and riding a bike at the East Coast Park are two of my best experiences while on tour in Singapore. My senior companions decided to just sleep it off/ watch movie at the hotel during our last day in Singapore but I don't want to waste the chance to explore places so I made my own plans. Though it's raining that morning, I decided to walk from the hotel to this seaside park. It was such a joyful experience to be so close to nature! After walking by the beach, I decided to rent a bike which was cool because all you have to do is scan a QR code to do so.  It took me a while to figure it out but, luckily, I was able to unlock the bike and finally use it. This was the first time I biked in a foreign country (and all by myself) so this small adventure is quite memorable for me.
